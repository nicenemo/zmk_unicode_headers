Prior to the 18th century, they were concentrated in their homelands, in towns along river valleys of what is now southwestern North Carolina , southeastern Tennessee , southwestern Virginia , edges of western South Carolina , northern Georgia and northeastern Alabama with hunting grounds in Kentucky , together consisting of around 40,000 square miles.\n\nThe Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group. In the 19th century, James Mooney , an early American ethnographer , recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, where other Iroquoian peoples have been based.  However, anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte, writing in 2007, dated the split among the peoples as occurring earlier. He believes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region , and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago."

They are a brown-skinned, slim, and straight-haired ethnic group.\n\nThere are two major classifications based on the geographical location where they can be found. Central Tagbanwas are found in the western and eastern coastal areas of central Palawan. They are concentrated in the municipalities of Aborlan , Quezon , and Puerto Princesa . Calamian Tagbanwa , on the other hand, are found in Baras coast, Busuanga Island , Coron Island and in some parts of El Nido .  These two Tagbanwa subgroups speak the same languages but different tone and pronunciation and do not exactly have the same customs. The Tagbanwa are believed to have descended from the Tabon Man, making them one of the original inhabitants of the Philippines. They have a long history of resistance against foreign invaders, from the Spanish colonial period to the American era."

It is historically known as Tua Tham ( \u1a32\u1a60\u1a45\u1a6b\u1a35\u1a3e\u1a60\u1a3e\u1a7c or \u1a32\u1a60\u1a45\u1a6b\u1a35\u1a62\u1a3e\u1a60\u1a3e\u1a7c ). In Thailand and Myanmar , the script is often referred to as Lanna script ( Thai : \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e23\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e25\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32 RTGS : Akson Tham Lan Na ; Burmese : \u101c\u1014\u103a\u1014\u102c\u1021\u1000\u1039\u1001\u101b\u102c , MLCTS : Lanna Akhkara ) in relation to the historical kingdom of Lan Na situating in the Northern region of modern day Thailand and Kyaingtong , Shan state in Myanmar.   Local people in Northern Thailand also call the script as Tua Mueang ( \u1a32\u1a60\u1a45\u1a6b\u1a3e\u1a6e\u1a65\u1a6c\u1a26 , Northern Thai pronunciation:  listen \u24d8 ) in parallel to Kam Mueang , a local name for Northern Thai language .  In Laos and Isan region of Thailand, a variation of Tai Tham script, often dubbed Lao Tham , is also known by the locals as To Tham Lao ( Northeastern Thai : \u0e42\u0e15\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27 /to\u02d0\u02e9.t\u02b0am\u02e7\u02e5.la\u02d0w\u02e7/ , cf. Lao : \u0ec2\u0e95\u0e97\u0eb3/\u0ec2\u0e95\u0e97\u0eb1\u0ea1 BGN/PCGN to tham ) or Yuan script.  Tai Tham script is traditionally written on a dried palm leaf as a palm-leaf manuscript .\n\nThe Northern Thai language is a close relative of (standard) Thai . It is spoken by nearly 6 million people in Northern Thailand and several thousand in Laos of whom few are literate in Lanna script. The script is still read by older monks. Northern Thai has six linguistic tones and Thai only five, making transcription into the Thai alphabet problematic. There is some resurgent interest in the script among younger people, but an added complication is that the modern spoken form, called Kam Muang, differs in pronunciation from the older form."

They are primarily sorted by stroke count . They are the most popular system of radicals for dictionaries that order characters by radical and stroke count. They are encoded in Unicode alongside other CJK characters , under the block \"Kangxi radicals\", while graphical variants are included in the block \"CJK Radicals Supplement\".\n\nOriginally introduced in the Zihui dictionary of 1615, they are more commonly referred to in relation to the 1716 Kangxi Dictionary \u2014 Kangxi being the commissioning emperor's era name . The 1915 encyclopedic word dictionary Ciyuan also uses this system. In modern times, many dictionaries that list Traditional Chinese head characters continue to use this system, for example the Wang Li Character Dictionary of Ancient Chinese (2000). The system of 214 Kangxi radicals is based on the older system of 540 radicals used in the Han-era Shuowen Jiezi . Since 2009, the Chinese government has promoted a 201-radical system ( Table of Han Character Radicals ) called the Table of Indexing Chinese Character Components , as a national standard for use with simplified characters ."

The script was historically used in the regions of Bengal and Assam , that were east of the Padma .  It was primarily used in the eastern part of the Sylhet region , to document poetry known as puthis .  In the course of the twentieth century, it has lost much ground to the standardised Eastern Nagari script . Printing presses for Sylheti Nagri existed as late as into the 1970s, and in the 2000s,  the script was added to the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane ( BMP ).  (See Syloti Nagri (Unicode block) for more details.)\n\nHistorically the script was transcribed in Middle Bengali , though having similar characteristics to the more popular Dobhashi literary dialect, it was distinguished for its phonological influence from Sylheti .  It is also claimed that the orthography of the script equates with Sylheti, reflecting the phonetic and grammatical features of the vernacular, it provided a simpler and more precise representation than the more prevalent Bengali script .  Sylheti Nagri therefore represented a unique literary culture of the Sylhet region.   Contemporarily, the script is being revived by some as a key identity marker of Sylhet's cultural heritage."

It is first known from engravings on 6th century CE coins and copper plate inscriptions .  as verified by the various publications of the National Sahitya Akademi .  It was used until the 18th century, when it was replaced by the Bengali alphabet . A few manuscripts survive. In the 20th century, the script was revived and is again being used.  Beginning in 2021, the Government of Manipur began to use the Meitei  alongside the Bengali-Assamese script, per the Manipur Official Language (Amendment) Act, 2021 .\n\nSince Meitei does not have voiced consonants , there are only fifteen consonant letters used for native words, plus three letters for pure vowels. Nine additional consonants letters inherited from Indic languages are available for writing loan words. There are seven vowel diacritics and a final consonant ( /\u014b/ ) diacritic.

Such publication may include a font that supports the definition (showing the glyphs), and software making use of the private-use characters (e.g., a graphics character for a \"print document\" function). By definition, multiple private parties may assign different characters to the same code point, with the consequence that a user may see one private character from an installed font where a different one was intended."

The name is sometimes spelled Phaestos or Festos .\n\nThe disc was discovered in 1908 by the Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier during the excavation of the Minoan palace of Phaistos .  The disc is about 16\u00a0cm (6.3\u00a0in) in diameter and is covered on each side with a spiral text, consisting of a total of 241 occurrences of 45 distinct signs, which were created by pressing individual sign stamps onto the soft clay before firing.

Linear\u00a0A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization. It evolved into Linear B , which was used by the Mycenaeans to write an early form of Greek . It was discovered by the archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans in 1900. No texts in Linear A have yet been deciphered . Evans named the script \"Linear\" because its characters consisted simply of lines inscribed in clay, in contrast to the more pictographic characters in Cretan hieroglyphs \u2013 likewise undeciphered \u2013 that were used during the same period.\n\nLinear A belongs to a group of scripts that evolved independently of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian systems. During the second millennium BC, there were four major branches: Linear\u00a0A, Linear B , Cypro-Minoan , and Cretan hieroglyphic .  In the 1950s, Linear B was deciphered and found to have an underlying language of Mycenaean Greek . Linear A shares many glyphs and alloglyphs with Linear\u00a0B, and the syllabic glyphs are thought to notate similar syllabic values, but none of the proposed readings lead to a language that scholars can understand."

Other scholars use the term Imperial Aramaic in a narrower sense, reduced only to the Achaemenid period, basing that reduction on several strictly linguistic distinctions between the previous (Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian) phase and later (more prominent) Achaemenid phase."

The Greek historian Arrian in his Anabasis Alexandri (mid-2nd century CE) mentions the existence of a peculiar indigenous language in the city of Side, which is assumed to be the language of the coins and inscriptions.\nSidetic was probably closely related to Lydian , Carian and Lycian .\n\nSidetic was written with a script of the Anatolian group . The Sidetic alphabet has 31 identified letters, a few of which are clearly derived from Greek.  The script has been partially deciphered, though the phonetic values of many letters are uncertain."

The earliest preserved records belonging to the group are dated to the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE.  They were written in the Ancient South Arabian script .\n\nThere were a number of other Old South Arabian languages (e.g. Aws\u0101nian), of which very little evidence has survived, however. A set of possible surviving Sayhadic languages is attested in the Razihi language , Rijal Alma language , and Faifi language spoken in far north-west of Yemen and far south-west of Saudi Arabia , though these varieties of speech have both Arabic and Sayhadic features, and it is difficult to classify them as either Arabic dialects with a Sayhadic substratum , or Sayhadic languages that have been restructured under pressure of Arabic."

The term \" Newari \" is also used to refer to the language, although the Indic -i suffix is considered inappropriate by some Newar speakers.\n\nThe language served as the official language of Nepal during the Malla dynasty since the 14th century till the end of dynasty in 1769 during which the language was referred as \"Nepal Bhasa\", a term which literally means \"Nepalese Language\".   However, the language is not the same as Nepali , an Indo-Aryan language and the current official language of Nepal , which only got the name Nepali in the 1930s.

            "description": "Cuneiform  is a logo-syllabic writing system that was used to write several languages of the ancient Near East .  The script was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era .  Cuneiform scripts are marked by and named for the characteristic wedge-shaped impressions ( Latin : cuneus ) which form their signs . Cuneiform is the earliest known writing system   and was originally developed to write the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq ).\n\nOver the course of its history, cuneiform was adapted to write a number of languages in addition to Sumerian. Akkadian texts are attested from the 24th century\u00a0BC onward and make up the bulk of the cuneiform record.   Akkadian cuneiform was itself adapted to write the Hittite language in the early 2nd millennium\u00a0BC .   The other languages with significant cuneiform corpora are Eblaite , Elamite , Hurrian , Luwian , and Urartian . The Old Persian and Ugaritic alphabets feature cuneiform-style signs; however, they are unrelated to the cuneiform logo-syllabary proper. The latest known cuneiform tablet, an astronomical almanac from Uruk, dates to AD\u00a079/80."

The sign inventory is mostly based on the 1922 dictionary Liste der archaischen Keilschriftzeichen (LAK),  with a substantial number of characters (U+124D5 to U+12518) identified by their LAK number (or as composed of characters identified by their LAK number) rather than attempting to identify them by a reconstructed phonetic value.\nThe LAK has 870 signs in total, most of which are already covered in the previous Unicode blocks in the form of their Ur III continuants.\nThe Preliminary Proposal for the block was submitted in 2012."

The letters in various fonts often have specific, fixed meanings in particular areas of mathematics. By providing uniformity over numerous mathematical articles and books, these conventions help to read mathematical formulas. These also may be used to differentiate between concepts that share a letter in a single problem.\n\nUnicode includes many such symbols (in the range U+1D400\u2013U+1D7FF).\u00a0The rationale behind this is that it enables design and usage of special mathematical characters ( fonts ) that include all necessary properties to differentiate from other alphanumerics, e.g. in mathematics an italic letter \"\ud835\udc34\" can have a different meaning from a roman letter \"A\". Unicode originally included a limited set of such letter forms in its Letterlike Symbols block before completing the set of Latin and Greek letter forms in this block beginning in version 3.1."
