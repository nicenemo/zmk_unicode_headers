 * Sidetic is a member of the extinct Anatolian branch of the Indo-European
 * language family . It is known from legends of coins, found in Side at the
 * Pamphylian coast, that date to the period of approximately the 5th to 3rd
 * centuries BCE, and from two Greek–Sidetic bilingual inscriptions from the
 * 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. The Greek historian Arrian in his Anabasis
 * Alexandri (mid-2nd century CE) mentions the existence of a peculiar
 * indigenous language in the city of Side, which is assumed to be the
 * language of the coins and inscriptions. Sidetic was probably closely
 * related to Lydian , Carian and Lycian .
 * Sidetic was written with a script of the Anatolian group . The Sidetic
 * alphabet has 31 identified letters, a few of which are clearly derived from
 * Greek. The script has been partially deciphered, though the phonetic values
 * of many letters are uncertain.
