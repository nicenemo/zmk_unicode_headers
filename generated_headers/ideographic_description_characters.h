 * Ideographic Description Characters is a Unicode block containing graphic
 * characters used for describing CJK ideographs . They are used in
 * Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS) to provide a description of an
 * ideograph, in terms of what other ideographs make it up and how they are
 * laid out relative to one another. An IDS provides the reader with a
 * description of an ideograph that cannot be represented properly, usually
 * because it is not encoded in Unicode; rendering systems are not intended to
 * automatically compose the pieces into a complete ideograph, and the
 * descriptions are not standardized.
 * U+2FF0 to U+2FFB were introduced from GBK ; U+2FFC to U+2FFF were devised
 * later and introduced in Unicode 15.1 (2023).
 *

* Consistency Check:
* Total Defined Code Points: 16
* Total Significant Hex Values: 16
* Status: OK (Counts Match)
