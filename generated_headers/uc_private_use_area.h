/*
 * Unicode Block: Private Use Area
 * Range: U+E000..U+F8FF
 * Properties: Unicode 17.0.0
 * Block Data: Unicode 17.0.0
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * In Unicode , a Private Use Area ( PUA ) is a range of code points
 * that, by definition, will not be assigned characters by the standard.
 * Three Private Use Areas are defined: one in the Basic Multilingual
 * Plane ( U+E000–U+F8FF ), and one each in, and nearly covering, planes
 * 15 and 16 ( U+F0000–U+FFFFD , U+100000–U+10FFFD ). They are
 * intentionally left undefined so that third parties may assign their
 * own characters without conflicting with Unicode Standard assignments.
 * Under the Unicode Stability Policy, the Private Use Areas will remain
 * allocated for that purpose in all future Unicode versions.
 * Assignments to private-use code points need not be "private" in the
 * sense of strictly internal to an organisation; a number of assignment
 * schemes have been published by several organisations. Such publication
 * may include a font that supports the definition (showing the glyphs),
 * and software making use of the private-use characters (e.g., a
 * graphics character for a "print document" function). By definition,
 * multiple private parties may assign different characters to the same
 * code point, with the consequence that a user may see one private
 * character from an installed font where a different one was intended.
