 * Imperial Aramaic is a linguistic term, coined by modern scholars in order
 * to designate a specific historical variety of Aramaic language . The term
 * is polysemic , with two distinctive meanings, wider ( sociolinguistic ) and
 * narrower ( dialectological ). Since most surviving examples of the language
 * have been found in Egypt, the language is also referred to as Egyptian
 * Aramaic .
 * Some scholars use the term as a designation for a distinctive, socially
 * prominent phase in the history of Aramaic language, that lasted from the
 * middle of the 8th century BCE to the end of the 4th century BCE and was
 * marked by the use of Aramaic as a language of public life and
 * administration in the late Neo-Assyrian Empire and its successor states,
 * the Neo-Babylonian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire , also adding to that
 * some later (Post-Imperial) uses that persisted throughout the early
 * Hellenistic period. Other scholars use the term Imperial Aramaic in a
 * narrower sense, reduced only to the Achaemenid period, basing that
 * reduction on several strictly linguistic distinctions between the previous
 * (Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian) phase and later (more prominent)
 * Achaemenid phase.
