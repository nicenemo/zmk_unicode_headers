/*
 * Unicode Block: High Surrogates
 * Range: U+D800..U+DB7F
 * Properties: Unicode 17.0.0
 * Block Data: Unicode 17.0.0
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Unicode Consortium and the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2 / WG 2 jointly
 * collaborate on the list of the characters in the Universal Coded
 * Character Set . The Universal Coded Character Set, most commonly
 * called the Universal Character Set ( abbr. UCS, official designation:
 * ISO / IEC 10646), is an international standard to map characters ,
 * discrete symbols used in natural language , mathematics , music , and
 * other domains, to unique machine-readable data values. By creating
 * this mapping, the UCS enables computer software vendors to
 * interoperate , and transmit— interchange — UCS-encoded text strings
 * from one to another. Because it is a universal map, it can be used to
 * represent multiple languages at the same time. This avoids the
 * confusion of using multiple legacy character encodings , which can
 * result in the same sequence of codes having multiple interpretations
 * depending on the character encoding in use, resulting in mojibake if
 * the wrong one is chosen.
 * UCS has a potential capacity of over 1 million characters. Each UCS
 * character is abstractly represented by a code point , an integer
 * between 0 and 1,114,111 (1,114,112 = 2 20 + 2 16 or 17 × 2 16 = 0x
 * 110000 code points ), used to represent each character within the
 * internal logic of text processing software. As of Unicode 17.0,
 * released in September 2025, 303,808 (27%) of these code points are
 * allocated, 159,866 (14%) have been assigned characters, 137,468 (12%)
 * are reserved for private use , 2,048 are used to enable the mechanism
 * of surrogates , and 66 are designated as noncharacters , leaving the
 * remaining 810,304 (73%) unallocated. The number of encoded characters
 * is made up as follows:
