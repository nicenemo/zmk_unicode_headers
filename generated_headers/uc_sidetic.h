 * Sidetic is a member of the extinct Anatolian branch of the
 * Indo-European language family . It is known from legends of coins,
 * found in Side at the Pamphylian coast, that date to the period of
 * approximately the 5th to 3rd centuries BCE, and from two Greek–Sidetic
 * bilingual inscriptions from the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. The Greek
 * historian Arrian in his Anabasis Alexandri (mid-2nd century CE)
 * mentions the existence of a peculiar indigenous language in the city
 * of Side, which is assumed to be the language of the coins and
 * inscriptions.
 * Sidetic was probably closely related to Lydian , Carian and Lycian .
 * Sidetic was written with a script of the Anatolian group . The Sidetic
 * alphabet has 31 identified letters, a few of which are clearly derived
 * from Greek. The script has been partially deciphered, though the
 * phonetic values of many letters are uncertain.
