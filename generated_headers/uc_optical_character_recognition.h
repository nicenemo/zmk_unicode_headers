 * Optical character recognition or optical character reader ( OCR ) is
 * the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed,
 * handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a
 * scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene photo (for example
 * the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from
 * subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television
 * broadcast).
 * Widely used as a form of data entry from printed paper data records –
 * whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements , computerized
 * receipts, business cards, mail, printed data, or any suitable
 * documentation – it is a common method of digitizing printed texts so
 * that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more
 * compactly, displayed online, and used in machine processes such as
 * cognitive computing , machine translation , (extracted) text-to-speech
 * , key data and text mining . OCR is a field of research in pattern
 * recognition , artificial intelligence and computer vision .
